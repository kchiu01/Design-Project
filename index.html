            <p>The Jurassic period was 199.6 million to 145.5 million years ago it was divided into three epochs: Early, Middle, and Late. During this period dinosaurs ruled the land and came in all shapes and sizes. From massive herbivores like the Branchiosaurus to fearsome predators like the Allosaurus. It was characterised by a warm, wet climate that gave rise to lush vegetation and abundant life. It provided the perfect habitat for dinosaurs to thrive.</p></section>

            <section class="herbi1"><h2>Herbivores</h2><p>Herbivores stood out by their large size, with bulky bodies and limbs with rather tiny heads, although this was not always the case.They were known to eat mostly vegetables instead of meat.</p></section>      
            <section class="omni1"><h2>Omnivores</h2><p>Dinosaurs classified as omnivores consumed both plants and animals. Although many omnivore dinosaurs  ate plants or other non-animal forms of food, they are ultimately classified as "carnivorous" since they consumed flesh and other animals</p></section>
