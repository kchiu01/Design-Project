        <section class="armoured"><h2>Armoured Dinosaur</h2><p>Armoured Dinosaurs were characterized by the bony plates and spikes they had on their bodies to serve as protection. For Example: Ankylosaurs, (such as the Ankylosaurus), had a heavily armoured body with bony plates and spikes covering their backs, sides, and even eyelids. They also had a club-like tail that they could use as a weapon. </p></section>
        <section class="theropod"><h2>Theropod</h2><p>During the Jurassic, theropods were already  a diverse group of dinosaurs. Some well known and notable theropods from that time include the Allosaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Ceratosaurus. These dinosaurs were known for their sharp teeth, strong jaws, and ability to hunt and take down prey. There were also many subcategories of theropods, such as, Ceratosauria, Megalosauroidea, Coelurosauria and Tetanurae. </p></section>
        <section class="sauropod"><h2>Sauropod / Prosauropod</h2><p>The sauropods were known to be the largest dinosaurs during the jurassic. They were known for their long necks, massive bodies, and large legs. Some well known sauropods include the Diplodocus, Apatosaurus, and Brachiosaurus.These dinosaurs were herbivores and had to eat a large amount of vegetation to sustain their massive size. The sauropods also included many subcategories such as the diplodocoids and the brachiosaurids.</p></section>
        <section class="ornithopod"><h2>Ornithopod / Ornithischian</h2><p>Ornithopods were a group of herbivorous dinosaurs that thrived during the Jurassic period. They are known for their bird-like hips and specialized teeth for chewing vegetation.Some well known ornithopods. From the Jurassic, include Camptosaurus and Dryosaurus. These answers had a wide range of sizes, from small and agile to larger and more robust. The subcategories of ornithopods include iguanodontians and hypsilophodontids.</p></section>
