        <h2><b>What is a Fossil?</b></h2>
        <p class="fossilp"><h3>A fossil is a piece of physical proof of an extinct plant or animal. This could be their fossilized remains or other evidence, like footprints they left on the earth when they were living. An organism has the potential to become a fossil when it dies and is quickly covered in layers of mud or sand.
            Some of its body gets replaced by minerals rather than rotting away. In certain instances, including with small, soft-bodied animals, this procedure may be completed in a matter of days or even months. It might take thousands of years for larger objects to fossilize, such massive dinosaur bones. </h3></p>

        <h3><b>There are many steps towards fossilization:</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>The animal passes away.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The animal's muscles and soft tissues, such as its skin, begin to deteriorate. These leftovers might even be eaten by other creatures.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>The body is often buried in sand or mud before it totally disappears. Usually, at this stage, nothing is left except the bones and teeth.</h4></li>
            <li><h4>A thick layer of mud and sand accumulates on top. The layers below are compressed as a result of the immense weight and pressure applied to them. They finally transform into sedimentary rocks. (Sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, chalk, and shale.)</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Water seeps into the teeth and bones at this time, leaving behind minerals that cause the teeth and bones to turn stone.</h4></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2><b>Sedimentary Rocks</b></h2>
        <p><h3>Sedimentary rocks are composed of layers of grains. The layers that are the youngest are at the top and the oldest are at the bottom. The shattered remains of other rocks eventually combine to form all of these distinct sedimentary rocks. Fossils of plants and animals that were caught in the sediments during the formation of the rock, may also be found in sedimentary rocks.</h3></p>
